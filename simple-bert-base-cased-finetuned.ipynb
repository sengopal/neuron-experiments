If you are looking to deploy this model through SageMaker on Inf2 instance, please visit the [Sagemaker samples repository](https://github.com/aws-neuron/aws-neuron-sagemaker-samples/tree/master/inference/inf2-bert-on-sagemaker). \n",

This model has 12 layers, 768 hidden dimensions, 12 attention heads, and 110M total parameters. The final layer is a binary classification head that has been trained on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (`mrpc`). The input to the model is two sentences and the output of the model is whether or not those sentences are a paraphrase of each other. \n",

    "## Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we benchmark the performance of the BERT model on Neuron. By default, models compiled with `torch_neuronx` will always execute on a *single* NeuronCore. When loading *multiple* models, the default behavior of the Neuron runtime is to evenly distribute models across all available NeuronCores. The runtime places models on the NeuronCore that has the fewest models loaded to it first. In the following section, we will `torch.jit.load` multiple instances of the model which should each be loaded onto their own NeuronCore. It is not useful to load more copies of a model than the number of NeuronCores on the instance since an individual NeuronCore can only execute one model at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that we are maximizing hardware utilization, we must run inferences using multiple threads in parallel. It is nearly always recommended to use some form of threading/multiprocessing and some form of model replication since even the smallest Neuron EC2 instance has 2 NeuronCores available. Applications with no form of threading are only capable of `1 / num_neuron_cores` hardware utilization which becomes especially problematic on large instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to view the hardware utilization is by executing the `neuron-top` application in the terminal while the benchmark is executing. If the monitor shows >90% utilization on all NeuronCores, this is a good indication that the hardware is being utilized effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we load two models, which utilizes all NeuronCores (2) on a `trn1.2xlarge` or `inf2.xlarge` instance. Additional models can be loaded and run in parallel on larger Trn1 or Inf2 instance sizes to increase throughput.\n",

    "Batch size has a direct impact on model performance. The NeuronCore architecture is optimized to maximize throughput with relatively small batch sizes. This means that a Neuron compiled model can outperform a GPU model, even if running single digit batch sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general best practice, we recommend optimizing your model’s throughput by compiling the model with a small batch size and gradually increasing it to find the peak throughput on Neuron. To minimize latency, using `batch size = 1` will nearly always be optimal. This batch size configuration is typically used for on-demand inference applications. To maximize throughput, *usually* `1 < batch_size < 10` is optimal. A configuration which uses a larger batch size is generally ideal for batched on-demand inference or offline batch processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we compile BERT for multiple batch size inputs. We then run inference on each batch size and benchmark the performance. Notice that latency increases consistently as the batch size increases. Throughput increases as well, up until a certain point where the input size becomes too large to be efficient."
